Dear Laserist,
	
TRICK-DESIGN can serve you with every art-work 
you might need for your Lasershow-Event. We do
work with Pangolins Lasershow-Designer and have
special knowledge in rotoscoping, animation,
morphing... To get an impression of our work we 
included these two animations:
	
	Boxer.ild - A rotoscoped boxer animation
	Horse.ild – A hand-animated horse animation 
	
	You can find a complete listing with some previews 
of all animations and stills we have available by
visiting our Web-Site:

 	NOTE:- You may uses these animations for demos and shows on
only one of your graphics systems.  You may NOT sell, trade or give
them to others or make use of them in any show or module that is
sold, given or traded to others.
	Contact us by e-mail to TRICK-DESIGN@t-online.de or by phone/fax at

Thanks,
